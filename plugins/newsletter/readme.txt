= GDPR =

The Newsletter Plugin provides all the technical tools needed to achieve GDPR compliancy and we're continuously working to improve them and to give support even for specific use cases.
The plugin does not collect users' own subscribers data, nor it has any access to those data: hence, we are not a data processor, so a data processing agreement is not needed.
Anyway if you configure the plugin to use external services (usually an external mail delivery service) you should check with that service if some sort of agreement is required.

= Support =

We provide support for our plugin on [Wordpress.org forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/newsletter) and through our [official forum](https://www.thenewsletterplugin.com/forums).

Premium Users with an active license have access to one-to-one support via our [ticketing system](https://www.thenewsletterplugin.com/support-ticket).
